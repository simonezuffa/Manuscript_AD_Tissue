# A Multi-Organ Murine Metabolomics Atlas Reveals Molecular Dysregulations in Alzheimer’s Disease

SUMMARY

The etiology of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) remains largely unclear but is likely driven by gene-environment interactions. Here, we present a multi-organ untargeted metabolomics dataset (2,271 samples) generated from five tissue types in two genetic AD mouse models under colonized or germ-free conditions, complemented by shotgun metagenomics sequencing data (666 samples). Systems-level analyses of 3xTg and 5xFAD mice reveal clusters of dysregulated molecular classes across tissues including carnitines, bile acids, B vitamins, and neurotransmitters. This signature, coupled with microbiome profiles, suggests increased oxidative stress via mitochondrial dysfunction. Molecular feature tracking via tissueMASST, a mass spectrometry search tool we developed to bridge animal model findings with human data, identifies microbially-modulated phenylacetyl-carnitine as positively associated with aging and cognitive impairment across human AD studies. With hundreds of yet-to-be-characterized metabolites, this public resource and its associated tools will aid future research in the pathophysiology of AD.
